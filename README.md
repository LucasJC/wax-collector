# WAX Collector

WAX Collector is a simple application for comparing two WAX accounts atomic assets for a given collection and schema.
The idea is to help collectors know what possible trades could be made between both accounts.

This application was built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/).
